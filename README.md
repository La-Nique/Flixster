### Notes
I successfully completed all tasks for Part 1 as well as attempted both bonus tasks but encountered a bit of a learning curve. I ran into a few difficulties during this project. The first challenge I faced was when I pulled from Github and my entire code whipped out and I was able to find knowledge to get my code back. The second challenge I had was when installed CocoaPod, eventually found out I had to use brew and manipulate some paths. The other challenges I had were in the bonus tasks.

The constrains were SO tricky. Grouped vertically then horizontally and automatic constrained the table view so that the entire area would fit. Understanding where the bounds are and how to manipulate and constrain was a bit confusing, but I was able to bound all my objects and keep them from continuing off the screen! The effort was totally worth it, I was curious in what more I can do with Swift.

I was able to run the app on my personal iPhone 11 Pro device, had to add my Apple account and authorize a developer team. I love how I'm able to have my own applications on my personal phone !!
