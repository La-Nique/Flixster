### Notes
I successfully completed all tasks for Part 1 as well as attempted both bonus tasks with some learning curve. I ran into a few difficulties during this project. The first challenge I faced was when I pulled from Github and my entire code whipped out and I was able to find knowledge to get my code back. The second challenge I had was install CocoaPod, similarly to my first challenge, I tried multiple troubleshoots with the advice of programming sites, but ultimately had to ask for technical guidance from the Slack channel, it took a while but wit

The constrains were tricky.

I was able to run the app on my personal iPhone 11 Pro device
